Learning JavaScript frameworks. Part of coarse jsramverk at BTH

[Webbprogrammering](https://www.bth.se/utbildning/program/pagwg20h/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Get started
To start the app, use `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

npm install
This command will install all modules listed as dependencies and is a first step to run the app.



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the app and runs mocha tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
